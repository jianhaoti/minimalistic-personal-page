The no cloning theorem is traditionally stated in terms of unitary operators. In this post, we give a simple proof of a generalized version of this theorem.

$$\text{ }$$

**Theorem.** _The mapping $\Delta: V \to V \otimes V$_

$$
\begin{equation}
v \mapsto v \otimes v
\end{equation}
$$

_of sending an element to the diagonal is *not* a linear transformation._

$$\text{ }$$

<u>Proof:</u> Suppose otherwise, and consider the mapping on $u + v$. We compute:

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        u \otimes u + u \otimes v + v \otimes u + v \otimes v
        &= (u + v) \otimes (u + v) \\
        &= \Delta(u+v) \\
        &= \Delta(u) + \Delta(v) \\
        &= u \otimes u + v \otimes v.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Moving terms around, we find $u \otimes v = -v \otimes u$, which is false for general vectors $u, v$. â–¡

Note that we don't need to appeal to any norms or Cauchy-Schwarz, which means this theorem holds in more general categories than normally stated. It's also interesting to observe that if we were in the exterior algebra, then cloning would be allowed.
