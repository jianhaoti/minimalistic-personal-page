Arguably the most fundamental equation of Riemannian geomtry is the Gauss-Codazzi equations, which relate the instrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of an embedding $\Sigma\subset M$. Here's the full beast

$$\text{ }$$

_Theorem [Gauss-Codazzi equations]_ Given a embedding of a surface $\Sigma$ into a Riemannian manifold $M$, we have

$$
Rm^\Sigma(X,Y,Z,W)= Rm^M(X,Y,Z,W)+A(X,W)A(Y,Z)-A(X,Z)A(Y,W).
$$
