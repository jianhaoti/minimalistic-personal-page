What are you, God?"

Ignorability is such an unscientific and arrogant assumption. The worst thing about it is that it's neither provable nor falsifiable. You can't even argue against the damn thing. It's just blind faith! Seeing an entire industry built on top of this is so ridiculous.

The _only_ way to do science is to make your theory _falsifiable_. Otherwise take your scriptures and apply for religious tax exemption.

thank u, next
